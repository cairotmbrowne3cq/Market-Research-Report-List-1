<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film for Nondestructive Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li><li>Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray film for nondestructive testing is primarily categorized into two types: non-screen type films and screen type films. Non-screen type films are direct exposure films that capture high-resolution images without the aid of intensifying screens, making them ideal for detecting small defects in materials. In contrast, screen type films utilize phosphorescent screens to enhance image contrast and reduce exposure time, making them suitable for faster testing processes. Both types play crucial roles in ensuring quality and safety in industrial applications.</p></p>
